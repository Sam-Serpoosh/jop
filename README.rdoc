== DESCRIPTION:

Jop is a gem that adds operations of the J programming language to Ruby arrays.

One could legitmately ask why anyone would want to do such a thing.  No one in
the Ruby community has been screaming "Oh, if only I could rotate N dimensional
matrices and reduce them with powerful operators from an obscure APL-derived
language, I could be happy."  But it's only a matter of time, isn't it?

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Currently supports a handful of monadic operators and a few dyads
* Operators can be chained together but there is no implementation
  of 'hook' or 'fork' yet
* Must operators assume arrays of integers and floats
* Error handling isn't graceful

== SYNOPSIS:

Imagine wanting to square an array of integers. We can do this in Jop using
the '*:' operator:

  [0, 1, 2].j('*:')

From this we get:

  [0, 2, 4]

In typical J fashion, operators work on arrays of any dimension:

  [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]].j('*:')

Here's the result:

  [[0, 1, 4], [9, 16, 25]]

In Jop, J operators are applied right to left.  We can do a 'take' operation
to get the the first array of  [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]] after squaring the
elements like this:

  [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]].j('{.*:')

Here we are applying the 'take' operator '{.' after the square operator '*:'
This is the result:

  [0, 1, 4]

At this point, you might be wondering where we get all of these cool
multi-dimensional arrays. We can create them using the the Shape operator
'$':

  [3 4].j('1 2 3 $')

This expression produces:

[[1, 2], [3, 1],  [2, 3],  [1, 2]]

3 and 4 are the dimensions of the array we are producing.  The array is filled
with the values 1 and 2 from the beginning, repeating the sequence as long as
there are more elements to fill.

Arrays can be of any dimension.  It you really want to try this, you can but it's
between you and the Ruby and runtime:

  [12, 12, 12, 12, 12].j('42 $')

The Coup de gr√¢ce is the insert operator '/'.  You can use it to insert an operator
between all elements of an array and evaluate it. This is akin to Ruby's inject:

  [1, 2, 3].j('+/')

This code inserts '+' between 1, 2, and 3.  We get:

  [6]

Insertion works on multi-dimensional arrays too:

  [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].j('+/')

We get:

  [5, 7, 9]

We can 'fold' across both dimensions like this:

  [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].j('+/+/')

That give us the total sum:

  [21]


== FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

* A DSL-ish syntax for the operations so that users
  don't have to deal with J syntax
* Support for full J syntax using printf-style argument interpolation
  to supply arrays within expressions

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 2.0 and patience

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install jop
